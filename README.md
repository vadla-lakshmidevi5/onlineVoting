      Our Online Voting is the most eco-friendly online voting system. This helps in  meeting  environmental and sustainability objectives by reducing paper usuage in  voting events as much as possible.

   Environmental Impact of Online Voting
      According to  research, holding a paper based election for 10,000 voters generates greenhouse gas emissions of over 500kg of CO2. That is equivalent to driving over 1000 miles in an average passenger car. 

Holding an election online is easier on the environment since there is less paper involved.
